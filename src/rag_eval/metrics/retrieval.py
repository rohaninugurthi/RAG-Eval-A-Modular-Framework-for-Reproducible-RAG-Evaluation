"""Retrieval quality metrics.

All functions operate on a ranked list of *retrieved identifiers* (highest
ranked first) and a set of *relevant identifiers*. Identifiers are opaque
strings; in the demo pipeline they are document ids obtained by collapsing a
ranked list of retrieved chunks onto their parent documents.

The functions are intentionally free of any embedding, model or framework
dependency so that every metric can be checked against a hand computed value.

Conventions
-----------
* ``retrieved`` is assumed to contain unique identifiers ordered by rank. When
  a metric only needs set membership (recall, hit rate) duplicates are handled
  gracefully anyway.
* ``k`` is one-indexed cut-off depth and must be a positive integer.
* Every metric returns a float in ``[0, 1]``.
